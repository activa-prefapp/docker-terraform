# Broadinstitute Docker Terraform

This repo is firstly forked from [broadinstitute/docker-terraform](https://github.com/broadinstitute/docker-terraform), and then copied into this repo as a
non-forked repo due to the reason that [LFS don't allow large files to be uploaded into public forked project](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/1906).

This is a sub-project of [Terraform Controller](https://github.com/zzxwill/terraform-controller)

# zzxwill/docker-terraform

- tag: 0.14.9
  
Terraform version is 0.14.9, and it's a long-running container.

- tag: 0.14.10

Terraform version is 0.14.10, and alibaba/null/template providers are built-in.

# Licensing

I asked [What's the license of this project?](https://github.com/broadinstitute/docker-terraform/issues/19) in the original
project, but I haven't received a response.
